## UAV Simulator Project Description

I've been working on this for a few weeks now, and I was encouraged to keep a development blog and document my process. The best place to start, I believe, would be a description of what it is exactly that I'm doing, and how I plan to go about it.

The project itself is a comprehensive UAV simulator (**U**nmanned **A**rial **V**ehicle) designed to be used as an easy testing platform for UAV systems.
While I'm currently developing for multicopter formats (quadcopters, hexacopters etc.), I plan on expanding the system for a much larger variety of aircraft in the future.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
